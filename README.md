# ðŸ’Œ Mailchain Compose

Mailchain Compose is a powerful tool that streamlines communication within DAOs by allowing you to send messages directly to specific roles. Whether you need to send a proposal alert to all followers or an announcement to only moderators, Mailchain Compose makes it easy to select the appropriate roles and deliver your messages directly to them

Mailchain Compose is specifically designed for Snapshot, an off-chain voting platform that features various DAOs such as Stargate DAO, Aave, ENS, and Developer DAO. In Snapshot, DAOs are called spaces, and members who join a DAO are called followers. With Mailchain Compose, you have complete control over who you want to send emails to within your DAO, making it easy to stay connected and up-to-date with your DAO.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started with Mailchain Compose, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Envoy-VC/mailchain-compose.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies using npm by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   and start a development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Set the permission for who can send mails by navigating to the `utils/config.ts` file and changing the `ROLE` variable to your desired role. By default, it is set to any, which means anyone can send mails. There are four options for the `ROLE` variable:
   - `any`: Anyone can send mails
   - `admins`: Only the addresses with `Admin` role can send mails.
   - `members`: Only the addresses with `Member` role can send mails.
   - `moderators`: Only the addresses with `Moderator` role can send mails.
4. Set up your environment variables by creating a new variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILCHAIN_SECRET_KEY` and setting the value to your Mailchain recovery phrase.
5. If you need to change the Snapshot environment to mainnet, go to the `pages/_app.ts` file and modify the `uri` variable in Apollo Client from `'https://testnet.snapshot.org/graphql'` to `'https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql'`.

That's it! You're ready to start using Mailchain Compose. For testing purposes, here are some example proposal IDs and space names on testnet environment to experiment with:
